    Letter From The Author

Hello, world! I, Fabi Nahian Madhurja, am just another enthusiastic learner who absolutely loves creating & sharing organised documentation whenever she’s in the process of learning something. I am currently trying to learn Python from various different sources and wanted to share my journey in a format that’s easy to read through. Thus, I am creating notebooks in Kaggle and keeping them organized in GitHub. 

I truly hope you find value in these notebooks because even if I end up helping just one person, it’s an amazing feeling! 

~ Thanks!
